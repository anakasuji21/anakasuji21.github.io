	<h4>November 3rd 2017</h4>
	This week I have worked on a little bit of sketchnoting and my project because I have missed quite a bit of 10th period iLab because my elective class have been working on a big lab this week. For my project I have been writing some project explanation which should be to public soon. 

	<h4>October 27th 2017</h4>
	<p> This week, I have done reflection on my presentation which I did last Sunday.Here is a picture of what it was like in Japan. I think all the projects were interesting. For example, a few people created apps for iPhones. One of my favorite apps was the one that would remind you of songs that you have listened on that day in the years before along with a picture of that day. On Friday, I have worked on my sketch noting assignment.
